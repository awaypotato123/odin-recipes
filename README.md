# odin-recipes
write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)
The project is about creating a basic website. The skills I learned are learning how to work with images, links on websites and how to work with Github.
