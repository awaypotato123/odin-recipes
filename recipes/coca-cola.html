    <h1>Senku's Coca-Cola</h1>
    <img src="../img/coca-cola.gif"
    <h2><p>Description</p></h2>
    <p>Could humans have made cola back in the stone age? Definitely not.Well, it would have been hard for the homo sapiens back then to even fathom a carbonated drink like cola. And even if they could fathom it, it would be too difficult for them to practically conceive the devices that would help them make it.However, Senku Ishigami, the science crazy big brains, managed to make cola in a world that had reverted back to the stone age due to almost 3000 years of inactivity, thanks to the human petrification. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Carbonated water(1 bottle)</li>
        <li>Honey(4-5 tablespoons</li>
        <li>Coriander</li>
        <li>Lemon/Lime(1)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Zest the Lime</li>
        <p>The first step in making Senku Cola is to zest the lime. Lime zest is basically the coloured outer surface of the peel. This is usually used to add a concentrated tangy flavour to the recipes.Zesting can be done using a zester or a peeler. Once you’re done zesting keep the lemon aside.</p>
        <li>Crush the coriander and mix it with the lime</li>
        <p>Shred the coriander leaves and crush them. You could do that using a cup or in a small mortar.The motive is to get the coriander leaves crushed properly.Now squeeze the lemon and add the juice into the crushed coriander along with the zested lime. Again continue with the crushing until the ingredients form a fine paste.Like Senku says, this paste will provide our homemade drink the smell of Cola. The quantity of lime juice to be added depends on your taste requirements.We’d say squeezing one half of the lemon should be more than enough.Now strain the mixture that you have created and keep it separate.</p>
        <li>Caramelize the honey</li>
        <p>Take the honey in a saucepan (well a small cup should suffice too) and heat it till it starts boiling.Now simmer the flames and cook it till the honey caramelizes (till it becomes nutty brown, you should get a slightly burnt smell by the time the honey caramelizes).Ideally, you’d leave the honey one for a minute or two at the most. The slightly burnt smell is ideally your cue to stop.</p>
        <li>Making the syrup</li>
        <p>Now mix the strained coriander-lime mixture and the caramelized honey to make the cola syrup. This syrup essentially provides the taste and the essence of the cola to your drink.The mixing should be done immediately after the honey is caramelized, otherwise the honey might harden (or thicken) again.</p>
        <li>Summon the cola</li>
        <p>Now in the final step, take a small quantity of the cola syrup that you have just prepared and mix it with carbonated water to ready your homemade cola.While the exact quantity of the mix was not revealed in the anime (because the coca-cola recipe has been a secret for ages?), from trial and error (and online sources) we found that you’d ideally add around 200 ml of carbonated water to 3-4 tbsp of the cola syrup.Lo behold, you’ve made your first bottle of Senku Cola.</p>
