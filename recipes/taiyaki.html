    <h1><p></p>Description</p></h1>
    <p><em>Taiyaki</em>(pronounced "Tie-Yah-Kee") is the quintessential Japanese street food and a very popular dessert at festivals. Westerners often wonder why taiyaki, a dessert, is shaped like a fish. It originated from imagawayaki, a very similar pastry which is a round shape rather than a fish shape. The exact origins are unknown, but sometime during the Edo period in what is now Tokyo, marketing-savvy shops started shaping imagawayaki in the shape of a taiâ€”a type of fish known as Japanese sea bream. The unique design sold better and the wildly popular taiyaki as we know it came to be.</p>
